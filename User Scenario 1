User Scenario 1
The first user of our parking lot availability app is Alfred Pennyworth. Alfred is a 21 year old senior computer science student at RPI. He currently lives at City Station West which is a bit ways off the heart of campus. He drives a 1997 Toyota Camry to get groceries, get to the library, and get to various events at the Union. Alfred is set on finishing strong in his school work and graduating this year.  Because of his immense college debt, he is highly motivated to get a good job and start living his life. Because this is his primary and sole reason for his investment here at RPI, he finds he has very little free time. In the little time he has to spare, he enjoys playing League of Legends just to keep his mind sane.

Lately, Alfred has been troubled by the parking situation at City Station West. Here's how parking currently works at City Station. There are two parking lots. The one located directly on the apartment block is the main lot. Once that gets filled you will have to drive all the way back up the hill to the overflow lot which is a block across from the apartment. The overflow lot is significantly farther than the main lot and is burdensome especially when carrying heavy books, project materials, groceries, etc… Ideally, one would want to park in the main lot but the problem is that because of its premium location, it gets filled up quickly.  Alfred, because of his strong motivation to get good grades and graduate with a good job, often stays up late doing work in the library. When he finally finishes his homework around 2 am, he gets in his car and drives back to his apartment. When he arrives at the main lot, he is annoyed and frustrated to find that it is completely filled up and is forced to drive back up the hill to the overflow lot and walk back down to the apartment. Alfred does not want to deal with this additional stress after all the stress he's currently dealing with from his school work. 

The solution to Alfred’s problems lies in the simplicity, convenience, and easy of use of our parking lot availability web application. Before Alfred leaves the library to start driving home, he pulls out his phone and browses to our parking lot available website.
