Deliverables:

- Vision Statement
The vision statement, also known as a project charter, should include:
An executive summary of the project, 
A thorough description of the proposed project which includes details that will interest potential stakeholders,
A business case for the project describing what benefit this project will provide for the stakeholders, and/or the user community. Include an analysis of the competition, market space, or similar commercial off the shelf software. 
A description of the specific project stakeholders (donâ€™t forget Team Instructor).
A description of the major features of the completed project, and 
A description of the major risks of the project.

- User Scenarios
Create two scenarios that describe a user in your target audience using your software to satisfy one of their goals. Include a description of each persona, details of their goals, illustrative details of the user interface with which the user interacts, and the sequence of steps they go through with the requisite system responses to accomplish their goal.

- Project Schedule 
A detailed schedule of the phases and iterations of your project. You must include iterations and dates for the development of each use case or feature, as well as estimates of the time required to complete each item on the schedule. The schedule must show the specific dates each phase and iteration begins and ends. Also include preliminary details and timing of the tasks included in completing your project.
